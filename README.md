## about

#### project
this is the first dynamic webpage i have made. the idea was to create a website with CRUD capabilities whilst learning .NET Core.

#### website

the webpage's purpose is to allow users to upload and store [their certificates](https://support.udemy.com/hc/article_attachments/115026199168/certificate.png) in a public, secure location with the posibility of displaying them to friends, family or employer.

#### technology

i tried to stay away from third party dependencies as i wanted to learn more about barebones .NET

* Entity Framework Core
* Sendgrid

#### Issues

* The biggest issues i had creating this website was getting the footer fixed at the bottom, i ended up deleting all scripts and css, it took me 2 days of 12 hour sessions to rewrite it all, but i learned alot. this [link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-keep-your-footer-where-it-belongs-59c6aa05c59c/) helped me alot!

* The second biggest issue i had was displaying PDF's as alot of certificate websites gives you the certificates in pdf format. This issue was fixed with [pdf.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) and encoding to base64

* the third issue is still here and i am not sure how to fix it. I tried to work out most of the audits flaws, but i am not to familiar with http protocols nor do i plan on spending time learning about it until i feel comfortable with .NET
